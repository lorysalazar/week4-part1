```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## 1. Confidence intervals

```{r}
otter_length <- c(38, 41, 50, 27, 32, 41, 48, 60, 43)


t.test(otter_length)
```
Testing null hypothesis that the mean otter length is 0. It is unlikely that we got our sample from a population of otters with mean = 0.

## T-test (1-sample t-test)

See a claim: mean otter length is 50 inches


```{r}
otter_test <- t.test(x = otter_length, mu = 50)
otter_test
```
Now testing null hypothesis that the mean otter length is 50.
Only 4% chance that I could take a sample from the population and get a mean value that is at least this different from the population mean.


## Two sample t-test

```{r}
desert_bighorns <- c(32, 44, 18, 26, 50, 33, 42, 20)
sierra_bighorns <- c(28, 31, 40, 42, 26, 29, 31)

t.test(x = desert_bighorns, y = sierra_bighorns)
```
